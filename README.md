# Procedural Terrin Generation using Cellular Automata
A few procedural terrain methods utilizing cellular automata

## Contents
### MeshGeneration
  3D Cellular Automata paired with the Marching Cubes algorithm for mesh creation
### Cellular Automata 3D
  3D Cellular Automata that renders voxel terrain (very slow, proof of concept)
### Cellular Automata 2D Heightmap
  2D Cellular Automata that creates a heightmap
