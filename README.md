# Procedural Terrin Generation using Cellular Automata
A few procedural terrain methods utilizing cellular automata

For anyone interested in the concepts used here and an in-depth description of each method, see the "research" paper I wrote tited: "Creating 3D Procedural Content with Cellular Automata" (pdf in repo)


## Contents
Brief description of the 3 unity projects in this repo
### MeshGeneration
  3D Cellular Automata paired with the Marching Cubes algorithm for mesh creation
### Cellular Automata 3D
  3D Cellular Automata that renders voxel terrain (very slow, proof of concept)
### Cellular Automata 2D Heightmap
  2D Cellular Automata that creates a heightmap
